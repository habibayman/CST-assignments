run the following commands, after changing the tracked folder's name in [script.js](https://github.com/habibayman/CST-assignments/blob/filewatcher-nodejs/File-Watcher/script.js):

```shell
npm install node
npm install log-timestamp
node script.js
```

watch your edits get logged in the console and you'll find a changesLog file output that gets updated every second too.
